# üöÄ CrowdfundFactory ‚Äì Create and Manage Multiple Crowdfund Campaigns

## üìå Description

**CrowdfundFactory** is a minimal smart contract factory that allows anyone to create multiple, independent instances of the SimpleCrowdfund contract. Each campaign created through the factory has its own parameters and logic, while the factory keeps track of all deployments.

This pattern enables DApps, DAOs, and platforms to programmatically spawn new crowdfunding campaigns with one centralized point of creation.

üöÄ Unlike traditional platforms that rely on intermediaries, **CrowdfundFactory** runs entirely on-chain ‚Äî meaning **no platform fees**, **no censorship**, and **guaranteed logic enforcement**. It‚Äôs ideal for startups, creators, communities, or developers looking to raise ETH securely and transparently from supporters.

Whether you're launching a new idea or backing one, **CrowdfundFactory** ensures for every campaign that:
- üí∏ **Funds are only released if the funding goal is reached**, protecting contributors from failed or abandoned projects.
- üîÅ **Automatic refunds are guaranteed** if the goal isn't met by the deadline ‚Äî no need to rely on third parties.
- üîê **Security is built-in**, using audited OpenZeppelin libraries and protections like reentrancy guards and strict ownership controls.
- ‚è≥ **Deadlines can be extended once**, providing flexibility while maintaining trust.

This contract gives backers peace of mind and empowers project owners with a trustless fundraising tool that can be easily deployed, customized, and integrated into any DApp or Web3 experience.

Built with **Solidity 0.8.28**, the contract includes basic protections such as **reentrancy guards** and ownership control using OpenZeppelin libraries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `CrowdfundFactory` acts as a generator of independent `SimpleCrowdfund` campaigns. Each time `createCrowdfund(...)` is called, a new crowdfunding contract is deployed with its own parameters (owner, goal, deadline).

All campaigns are mapped and indexed inside the factory using a counter (`crowdfundCount`) so they can be retrieved or displayed later.

This allows platforms and DApps to launch **unlimited campaigns**, each running independently with no overlap in funds or logic.

## üß™ Testing with Foundry

The contract is thoroughly tested using **Foundry**, with complete coverage across all major functionalities.

Two helper contracts are used to simulate edge cases and failure scenarios:

- **`RejectEther`**: Simulates a contract that **refuses to accept ETH**, used to test how the crowdfund contract handles failed withdrawals to the owner.
- **`RejectRefund`**: Simulates a contributor that **rejects refunds**, ensuring the refund logic handles recipient-side failures safely.
